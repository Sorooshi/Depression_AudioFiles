# Methodology:

Please, use the link below to implement the below-mentioned algorithms in the form of a Python script.

- Jupyter notebooks are NOT accepted as final implementations. 

- If you are interested, you can consult my recent python package for detecting dyslexia (DD) to shape the structure of your project and create your test beds:

DD repo: https://github.com/Sorooshi/DD

To read:

- audio_paper0 up to section 2;

- audio_paper1 up to the 4th page;

- go through DeepAR.pdf, TFP.pdf N-BEATS.pdf


Methods to implement:



1) Amazon DeepAR https://github.com/arrigonialberto86/deepar (DeepAR.pdf) 

OR 

https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pytorch_forecasting.models.deepar.DeepAR.html

2) Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFP) https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tft

3) https://github.com/ServiceNow/N-BEATS (N-BEATS.pdf)

4) 
5) 


Tune the parameters using:

- Bayesian Optimization vs Grid-Search (let us discuss and decide later) in five fold-cross validation framework. 

- Train and test using 10 fold-cross validation framework
